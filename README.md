Comparative Analysis of Logistic Regression Models Using Scikit-learn and Statsmodels for Customer Churn Prediction

# Project Overview

This project performs a comparative analysis of logistic regression models using two prominent Python libraries — **Scikit-learn** and **Statsmodels** — to predict **customer churn**. The dataset used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset).

The goal is to evaluate both libraries in terms of:
- Model performance
- Ease of use
- Interpretability
- Suitability for practical applications

- # Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Statsmodels**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

- # Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **File used**: `customer_churn_dataset-training-master.csv`
- **Target variable**: `churn`

# Key Steps

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized class imbalance
- Identified correlations and trends using heatmaps and bar plots

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and categorical encoding
- Scaled numerical features for model training

### 3. Model Development
- Built two logistic regression models:
  - `Scikit-learn` model: Emphasis on predictive performance and pipeline integration
  - `Statsmodels` model: Focus on statistical significance and interpretability

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Compared models using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Model summaries (for Statsmodels)
